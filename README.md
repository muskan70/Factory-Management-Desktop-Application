## factory management system.
In this,a java based factory management software is created for maintaining records related to:
- sales 
- production
- employees list
- costumers list
- expenditure 
- department list

Either owner or his managers can log into the system only and they can add , delete and view data only.

Further an owner can add new manager,view manager list as well as delete a manager.

If we talk about features of work details we have four categories :
- Employees Details in which we can check list of each department,check a single employee work record date wise,add an employee,view
employees list,delete employee.
- Sales Details in which we can check records of sales date wise,list of costumers,record of a particular costumer,add costumer,delete 
costumer.
- Expenditure details in which we can store daily expenditure details in the factory for maintainence and material related works.
- Production Details in which we can check production records of all products,add a product,delete product,add production record of 
a product.
